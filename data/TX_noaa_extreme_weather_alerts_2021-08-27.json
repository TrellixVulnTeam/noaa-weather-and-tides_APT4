                "description": "This product covers Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas\n\n**HURRICANE WATCHES HAVE BEEN ISSUED FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN\nGULF COAST**\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Storm Surge Watch and Hurricane Watch have been issued for\nEast Cameron, Iberia, St. Mary, and Vermilion\n- A Storm Surge Watch has been issued for Lower St. Martin and\nWest Cameron\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Storm Surge Watch and Hurricane Watch are in effect for East\nCameron, Iberia, St. Mary, and Vermilion\n- A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for Lower St. Martin and West\nCameron\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 1110 miles southeast of Cameron LA or about 1020 miles\nsoutheast of Morgan City LA\n- 18.6N 80.5W\n- Storm Intensity 40 mph\n- Movement Northwest or 320 degrees at 12 mph\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nTropical Storm Ida was located near latitude 18.6 North, longitude 80.5 West.\nIda is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph and this general motion should\ncontinue over the next few days.  On the forecast track, the center of Ida will\npass near or over the Cayman Islands during the next few hours, the Isle of Youth\nand western Cuba Friday, and over the southeastern and central Gulf of Mexico Friday\nnight and Saturday. It is expected to make landfall as a strong hurricane on the northern\nGulf Coast Sunday and will bring life-threatening storm surge flooding, damaging winds,\nand flash flooding to portions of south central and central Louisiana. Conditions are\ncurrently expected to deteriorate overnight Saturday into Sunday, so all residents should\ntake Friday and Saturday to prepare for this storm. Remember, if your\nlocal officials order an evacuation, you need to leave!\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nPrepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts\nacross south central Louisiana. Potential impacts in this area\ninclude:\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to structural\ndamage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.\nDamage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be\nuninhabitable for weeks.\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Several bridges and access routes\nimpassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\nAlso, prepare for dangerous wind having possible limited to\nsignificant impacts across southwest and central Louisiana.\n\n* SURGE:\nPrepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant\nimpacts across coastal south central Louisiana. Potential impacts in\nthis area include:\n- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nwaves. Damage to non-elevated structures is possible.\n- Sections of escape routes and secondary roads become weakened\nor washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low spots.\n- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and\nnumerous rip currents.\n- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, and piers. Several small\ncraft broken away from moorings, especially in unprotected\nanchorages.\n\nAlso, prepare for locally hazardous surge having possible limited\nimpacts across coastal southwest Louisiana.\n\nElsewhere across Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas, little to\nno impact is anticipated.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPrepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant\nimpacts across south central Louisiana. Potential impacts\ninclude:\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter\ncurrents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially\nin usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and\nditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places may experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nbecome hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\nPrepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across southwest Louisiana.\n\nElsewhere across Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas, little to\nno impact is anticipated.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nPrepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across south\ncentral Louisiana. Potential impacts include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\ntoppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\nlarge tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\nknocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas, little to\nno impact is anticipated.\n\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\n----------------------------------\n\n* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended\npreparedness actions, including possible evacuation. If ordered to\nevacuate, do so immediately.\n\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time\nto get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle\nahead of time.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies\nkit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your\nhome or business.\n\nWhen making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the\nexact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging\nwind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the\ncenter of the storm.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org\n\nNEXT UPDATE\n-----------\n\nThe next local statement will be issued by the National Weather\nService in Lake Charles LA around 5 AM CDT, or sooner if conditions\nwarrant.",
