Ida is moving toward the\nnorthwest near 15 mph and this general motion should continue over the\nnext few days. On the forecast track, the center of Ida will move\nacross western Cuba today, and over the southeastern and\ncentral Gulf of Mexico tonight and Saturday. The system is forecast to\napproach the U.S. northern Gulf coast on Sunday as a Major hurricane.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nProtect against life-threatening wind having possible devastating\nimpacts across south central and east central Louisianan. Potential\nimpacts in this area include:\n- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof\nand wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage\ngreatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations\nmay be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\n- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Many bridges and access routes\nimpassable.\n- Widespread power and communications outages.\n\nAlso, protect against life-threatening wind having possible limited\nto extensive impacts across elsewhere across the remainder of southwest\nand central Louisiana.\n\n* SURGE:\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible extensive\nimpacts across from Pecan Island around Vermilion Bay and Atchafalaya\nBay Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings,\nwith several washing away. Damage compounded by floating\ndebris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of escape routes and secondary roads washed out\nor severely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may\nbecome stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, and piers. Many small craft\nbroken away from moorings, especially in unprotected anchorages\nwith some lifted onshore and stranded.\n\nAlso, protect against life-threatening surge having possible\nsignificant impacts across Cameron Vermimilion Parish line to Pecan Island.\n\nAlso, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited\nimpacts across Cameron Parish.\n\nElsewhere across Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas, little to\nno impact is anticipated.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nProtect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible\nextensive impacts across . Potential\nimpacts include:\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may\nbecome stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed\naway. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.\nStreets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with\nunderpasses submerged.
