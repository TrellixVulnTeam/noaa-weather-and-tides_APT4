                "description": "This product covers Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas\n\n**IDA NOW ENTERING THE GULF OF MEXICO, FORECAST TO RAPIDLY INTENSIFY\nBEFORE REACHING THE NORTHERN GULF COAST**\n\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- None\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Allen, Beauregard,\nCalcasieu, Jefferson Davis, Rapides, and Vernon\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Hurricane Warning are in effect for\nIberia, Lower St. Martin, St. Mary, and Vermilion\n- A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for West Cameron\n- A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Acadia, Avoyelles,\nEvangeline, Lafayette, St. Landry, and Upper St. Martin\n- A Tropical Storm Warning, Storm Surge Watch, and Hurricane\nWatch are in effect for East Cameron\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 690 miles southeast of Intracoastal City LA or about 640\nmiles southeast of Morgan City LA\n- 23.0N 84.0W\n- Storm Intensity 80 mph\n- Movement Northwest or 320 degrees at 15 mph\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nHurricane Ida is now entering the southeast Gulf of Mexico. The center\nof Hurricane Ida was located near latitude 23.0 North, longitude\n84.0 West. Ida is moving toward the northwest near 15 mph and this\ngeneral motion should continue until Ida reaches the northern Gulf\ncoast on Sunday. A slower northward motion is forecast after Ida moves\ninland. On the forecast track, the center of Ida will move over the\nsoutheastern and central Gulf of Mexico during the next day or two and\nmake landfall along the U.S. northern Gulf coast within the hurricane\nwarning area by late Sunday.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nProtect against life-threatening wind having possible devastating\nimpacts across South Central and East Central Louisiana. Potential impacts in\nthis area include:\n- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof\nand wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage\ngreatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations\nmay be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\n- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Many bridges and access routes\nimpassable.\n- Widespread power and communications outages.\n\nAlso, protect against life-threatening wind having possible limited\nto extensive impacts across Southwest Louisiana.\n\n* SURGE:\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible extensive\nimpacts from Pecan Island eastward across Vermilion and Atchafalaya\nBays. Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings,\nwith several washing away. Damage compounded by floating\ndebris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of escape routes and secondary roads washed out\nor severely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may\nbecome stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, and piers. Many small craft\nbroken away from moorings, especially in unprotected anchorages\nwith some lifted onshore and stranded.\n\nAlso, protect against life-threatening surge having possible\nsignificant impacts across the Cameron and Vermilion parish line to Pecan Island.\n\nAlso, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited\nimpacts across Cameron Parish.\n\nElsewhere across Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas, little to\nno impact is anticipated.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nProtect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible\nextensive impacts across South Central Louisiana. Potential\nimpacts include:\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may\nbecome stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed\naway. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.\nStreets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with\nunderpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.\nMany road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.\n\nProtect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible limited\nto significant impacts across Central and Southwest Louisiana.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nProtect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts\nacross Central and South Central Louisiana. Potential impacts include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\ntoppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\nlarge tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\nknocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas, little to\nno impact is anticipated.\n\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\n----------------------------------\n\n* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions, including\npossible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.\n\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time to\nget there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle ahead of time.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and\nproperty in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a\nsafe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.\n\nIf you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.\nAllow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges\nwill be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather\nforecast before departing and drive with caution.\n\nIf heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter\nrules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or have\npets. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.\n\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets\nfor official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes\nto the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather\nwarnings.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org\n\nNEXT UPDATE\n-----------\n\nThe next local statement will be issued by the National Weather\nService in Lake Charles LA around 5 AM CDT, or sooner if conditions\nwarrant.",

Ida is moving toward the\nnorthwest near 15 mph and this general motion should continue over the\nnext few days. On the forecast track, the center of Ida will move\nacross western Cuba today, and over the southeastern and\ncentral Gulf of Mexico tonight and Saturday. The system is forecast to\napproach the U.S. northern Gulf coast on Sunday as a Major hurricane.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nProtect against life-threatening wind having possible devastating\nimpacts across south central and east central Louisianan. Potential\nimpacts in this area include:\n- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof\nand wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage\ngreatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations\nmay be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\n- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Many bridges and access routes\nimpassable.\n- Widespread power and communications outages.\n\nAlso, protect against life-threatening wind having possible limited\nto extensive impacts across elsewhere across the remainder of southwest\nand central Louisiana.\n\n* SURGE:\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible extensive\nimpacts across from Pecan Island around Vermilion Bay and Atchafalaya\nBay Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings,\nwith several washing away. Damage compounded by floating\ndebris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of escape routes and secondary roads washed out\nor severely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may\nbecome stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, and piers. Many small craft\nbroken away from moorings, especially in unprotected anchorages\nwith some lifted onshore and stranded.\n\nAlso, protect against life-threatening surge having possible\nsignificant impacts across Cameron Vermimilion Parish line to Pecan Island.\n\nAlso, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited\nimpacts across Cameron Parish.\n\nElsewhere across Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas, little to\nno impact is anticipated.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nProtect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible\nextensive impacts across . Potential\nimpacts include:\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may\nbecome stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed\naway. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.\nStreets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with\nunderpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.\nMany road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.\n\nProtect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible limited\nto significant impacts across South Central Louisiana.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nProtect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts\nacross East Central and South Central Louisiana. Potential impacts\ninclude:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\ntoppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\nlarge tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\nknocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across Southwest Louisiana and Southeast Texas, little to\nno impact is anticipated.\n\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\n----------------------------------\n\n* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\nimmediately.\n\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind\nand allow extra time to get there. Take your emergency supplies kit.\nGas up your vehicle ahead of time.\n\n\n\nOTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and\nproperty in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a\nsafe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.\n\nIf you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.\nAllow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges\nwill be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather\nforecast before departing and drive with caution.\n\nFailure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of\nlife. Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any\norders that are issued. Remember, during the storm 9 1 1 Emergency\nServices may not be able to immediately respond if conditions are\nunsafe. This should be a big factor in your decision making.\n\nKeep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles\ncan be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide\npoisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly\nventilated area.\n\nIt is important to remain calm, informed, and focused during an\nemergency. Be patient and helpful with those you encounter.\n\nStorm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and\nhurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge\nzone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find\nyourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed\nevacuation orders issued by the local authorities.\n\nIf in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large\ntrees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or\non a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of\nstrong winds or flooding.\n\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets\nfor official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes\nto the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather\nwarnings.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org\n\nNEXT UPDATE\n-----------\n\nThe next local statement will be issued by the National Weather\nService in Lake Charles LA around 1030 PM CDT, or sooner if\nconditions warrant.",
