Monitor\nthose with a higher vulnerability to heat, including small\nchildren. Check in on family, friends, and neighbors, especially\nthe elderly. If engaging in outdoor activity, take longer and\nmore frequent breaks and avoid the hottest parts of the day.\nNever leave kids or pets unattended in cars.\n\nPublic cooling shelters are available in some areas.
